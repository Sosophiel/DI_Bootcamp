/* Use the same form structure as Exercise 1.
When you click the Send button, the form will be submitted with a POST method.(you can use the same HTML file for the action url)
Where will the sent data appear? Hint : Look at the Network Tab
 

the data won't appear in the url because the method is POST and won't allowed to be called by the browser
