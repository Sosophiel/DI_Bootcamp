         <h3 id="conception">Simba's Conception</h3>

         

                    <p>The Lion King was conceived by Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg in 1988.[2] Filmmakers jokingly nicknamed the film "Bambi in Africa" due similarities between the film and Disney's own Bambi (1942), and their respective main characters. 
                        Although considered an original coming-of-age[6] story that follows Simba as he grows up and "tak[es] on the responsibility of adulthood," directors Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff drew inspiration 
                        from other sources for the character, namely the biblical figures Moses and Joseph.[7] Producer Don Hahn said that, like them, Simba is "born into royalty, is then exiled, and has to return to claim [his] kingdom".
                        Unlike the studio's three previous films The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Aladdin (1992) which are essentially love stories, 
                        The Lion King focuses on Simba's relationship with his father instead, which Allers identified as "The real heart and emotional underpinning of the whole story".[9] In April 1992, 
                        the filmmakers hosted a "brainstorming session" in which much of the film's original story was largely re-written, particularly Simba's personality.</p>
                        
                        <p>Originally, Simba was intended to remain with the pride after Mufasa's death until this idea was re-written in order to make the character more "likable and sympathetic."[9]
                        Several film and entertainment critics have noted similarities and parallels between the stories of The Lion King and William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet, and their protagonists.
                        Allers said that these similarities were not initially intentional and came as a surprise to the filmmakers themselves; they noticed the similarities only after the story was established and they eventually decided to pursue it. 
                        According to Hahn, "When we first pitched the revised outline of the movie ... someone in the room announced that its themes and relationships were similar to Hamlet. 
                        Everyone responded favorably to the idea that we were doing something Shakespearean, so we continued to look for ways to model our film on that all-time classic."[8]
                        Screenwriter Jonathan Roberts said that, in a musical, songs are used to convey a character's emotions and "I wants." 
                        Composer Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice wrote the song "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" in order to give Simba a medium through which he can express his desire to become King of the Pride Lands. 
                        Roberts said, "It's a way for storytellers to move the story and deliver the direction of the character."[14]</p>
