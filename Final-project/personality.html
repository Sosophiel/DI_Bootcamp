      When The Lion King was green-lit, its concept and story were not well received by studio employees. 
      To guarantee the release of at least one successful film, Katzenberg divided the studio into two separate projects: 
      The Lion King and Pocahontas (1995), the latter of which was expected to be the more successful film. 
      Because of this assumption, the majority of the studio's more seasoned animators gravitated towards Pocahontas, while less experienced animators were assigned to work on The Lion King, which was deemed a "risk".
      Co-director Rob Minkoff received this positively, saying that this decision "gave a lot of newer animators a chance to step up to leadership roles."</p>
      <p>
      The role of animating Simba was divided between Ruben A. Aquino and Mark Henn, the former of whom was the first animator to be assigned to the project.[9] While Henn served as the supervising animator of Simba as a cub, credited as young Simba,[31] Aquino was placed in charge of animating the character as he appears as an adult.[32] 
      The Lion King was Disney's first animated feature film to feature absolutely no humans since Robin Hood (1973). According to Aquino, animating four-legged creatures is difficult because the artists are faced with the task of drawing "twice as many legs ... as you do with human characters" and must also attribute to them both human and animal-like qualities. 
      For assistance, Aquino drew influence from previous animated films that feature four-legged creatures as their main characters, citing Bambi, Lady and the Tramp (1955) and The Jungle Book (1967) as his main sources of inspiration.
      Before The Lion King, Henn's experience as a supervising animator was limited to predominantly female characters;[34][35] he had just recently completed work on Ariel from The Little Mermaid (1989), Belle from Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Jasmine from Aladdin (1992).[30] 
      When he became involved with The Lion King, Henn initially expressed interest in animating the film's villain, Scar, because he wanted to do "something different."[34] However, producer Don Hahn felt that he was better suited for animating Simba.
       Henn approaches animating new characters by "put[ting himself] into the character's situation.</p>
       <p>
      " Simba proved to be a challenge because Henn was faced with the task of creating an animated character who would both appear and behave like a real lion cub. To achieve this, Henn visited zoos, sketched and studied live lion cubs that were brought into the studio for research, and frequently consulted with wildlife experts. 
      Simba's short hair follows from the extreme heat of the lion's native climate, as does the thickness of the skin depicted on each paw, allowing him to swiftly navigate the grasslands.</p>

      When it came time to animate Simba during the "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" musical sequence, Henn felt it essential that the character remain on all fours at all times, despite the fact that he is meant to be dancing.[
      In terms of personality, Henn aimed to depict Simba as a "cocky, confident character" at the beginning of the film, who must eventually mature and learn to take responsibility.[34] 
      The animators would often observe and document the voice actors while they recorded their dialogue, using their movements and mannerisms as a visual aid. Actor Jonathan Taylor Thomas, who provided the voice of young Simba, served as inspiration for the design and personality of Simba. 
      Henn said, "I loved watching Jonathan Taylor Thomas when he was a boy on Home Improvement, 
      and getting to meet him and observe him."[38]
       Although Aquino was responsible for animating the majority of Simba's adult sequences, Henn animated the character's first appearance as an adult that occurs near the end of the "Hakuna Matata" musical number.[39]
